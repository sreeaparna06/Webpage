<h2>style="text-align:center;colour:black;font-size:50px">MOTHER</h2>
<P>Mother is the most beautiful word in the world.
She helps us a lot in our carrier buliding.
She the most beautiful women in the world.
Mothers proved themselves as a great doctor when some their family members are sick.
And teaching their childrens good words and good habbbits they proved themselves as a good teacher.
They becomes a good chief when someone is hungry at house.
By giving birth to the child they proves that they are so strong and can bear anything for their childrens.
A great salute to the mothers who sacrifised their lifes for their childrens,family and society.
We indians treat womens as goddess.</P>
